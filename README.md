# CBC Autoverification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the machine learning code used in the study:

**"Optimizing Laboratory Autoverification in Complete Blood Count Testing Using Machine Learning: A Performance Evaluation Study"**

## Overview
The code implements Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models for classifying complete blood count (CBC) results as verifiable or non-verifiable.

## Contents
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metric calculation (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV)

## Data availability
Due to institutional and ethical restrictions, patient-level data are not publicly available.
The code is provided to support reproducibility of the analytical framework.

## Environment
- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- pandas
- numpy

## Disclaimer
This code is intended for research and reproducibility purposes only and is not a clinical decision support system.
